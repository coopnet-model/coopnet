{"sent1": "perturbative techniques allows us to obtain analytical asymptotic expressions for the main global parameters of the model which lead to the following rigorous results: (i) a new criterion for no sure extinction, (ii) a generalization and proof, for this particular class of models, of the lethal mutagenesis criterion proposed by bull, sanjuan and wilke (theory of lethal mutagenesis for viruses, j . virology 18 (2007) 29302939), (iii) a new proposal for the notion of relaxation time with a quantitative prescription for its evaluation, (iv) the quantitative description of the evolution of the expected values in in four distinct stages: extinction threshold, lethal mutagenesis, stationary equilibrium and transient .
